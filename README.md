# Push-Button-for-Conveyor-motor


# Project Description
This project demonstrates the control of a conveyor system using a single push button. The main goal is to simplify the start-stop operation of a conveyor with minimal user interaction. Pressing the button once starts the conveyor; pressing it again stops the conveyor. This toggling behavior is achieved using latching logic implemented in the PLC.

## PLC used 1512C-1 PN
