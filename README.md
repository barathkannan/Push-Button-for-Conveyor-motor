# Push-Button-for-Conveyor-motor
Single Push Button Conveyor Station


Project Description
This project demonstrates the control of a conveyor system using a single push button. The main goal is to simplify the start-stop operation of a conveyor with minimal user interaction. Pressing the button once starts the conveyor; pressing it again stops the conveyor. This toggling behavior is achieved using latching logic implemented in the PLC.


Key Features:

Start/Stop control using a single push button

PLC-based latching logic

Safety interlock integration

Useful for operator-friendly material handling stations


Applications:

Ideal for small automation setups, educational demonstrations, or operator stations in industries where compact and simple control is required.
